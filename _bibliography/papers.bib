  abstract    = {Resource Aware ML (RaML) is a tool that can compute the resource use of programs in the ML
                 family (SML, OCaml, etc) through a type-based technique known as automatic amortized resource
                 analysis (AARA). Existing implementations of RaML have numerous shortcomings, such as lacking
                 support for regular recursive types and being difficult to maintain.
                 
                 This thesis presents the theory and implementation of a new and improved version of RaML, Re-
                 source Aware ML 2. Using work by Grosen et al, RaML 2 can analyze programs with regular recursive
                 types, non-monotone resource analysis, and more. Furthermore, it presents the univariate AARA theory
                 that the implementation is based on; univariate AARA's expressive power is a subset of Grosen et al's
                 multivariate AARA, but it is still a unique variant.
                 
                 Additionally, this thesis presents supporting features for a full RaML implementation. This includes
                 a new Intermediate Representation (IR) that the resource analysis operates on; this IR is implemented
                 efficiently with an infrastructure known as Abstract Binding Trees. Other contributions include an SML
                 frontend implementation that can translate arbitrary SML code to the RaML IR, as well as a linear
                 programming solver backend.}
