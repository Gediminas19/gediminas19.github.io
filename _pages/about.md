I am a first-year PhD student in the Principles of Programming (PoP) group in Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Department (CMU CSD), advised by [Jan Hoffmann](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~janh/). My research areas are programming languages and verification, with a focus on type systems and static resource analysis of programs.

Currently, I am developing Resource Aware ML (RaML) 2, a tool that automatically and statically derives worst-case resource-use bounds for SML and OCaml programs, and successor to [RaML](https://www.raml.co/about/). This involves designing, verifying, and implementing various Automatic Amortized Resource Analysis (AARA) type systems.

Before my PhD, I received my MS from CMU in 2023, and my BS from CMU in 2022.
