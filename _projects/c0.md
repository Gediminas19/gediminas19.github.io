### Collaborators
- Ishan Bhargava

### Languages Involved
- Implementation: Rust
- Source: [C0](https://c0.cs.cmu.edu/), a safe subset of C
- Target: x86 asm

### Overview
- Studied and implemented compiler optimizations including Partial Redundancy Elimination (PRE) and Aggressive Dead Code Elimination (ADCE) for a [C0](https://c0.cs.cmu.edu/) to x86 asm compiler, achieving speedups on par with GCC -O1
- Expanded compiler to support algebraic datatypes (ADTs) and function closures, including parsing, typechecking, and codegen
